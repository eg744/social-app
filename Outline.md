Creating e-commerce app with Next.js, TailwindCSS. Will update with more detailed outline

Want to get into Next's server side tools more than I did in pet adoption app. Focusing on front end, I will see what I can implement in terms of backend, I should make user accounts and connect to a database if I can.

I have a few ideas for APIs, there is certain to be one for what I want. I should use multiple to get info from different endpoints.

Focus more on writing clean reusable code, though functional I believe my projects so far have been sloppy. Take the time to think things through more carefully now that I've learned some of the basics. Be more mindful about using conventional project structures and create meaningful, useful components.

I'll use create T3 app
Next.js
tRPC
Tailwind CSS
TypeScript
Prisma
NextAuth.js

front page with new and featured items. Try to make a more professional navigation bar not with the strangely animated mobile button. Tailwind should help with this, see if there are some styles I can use for the nav and footer that look more standard/ professional.

user auth with nextauth

review function on each item: use tRPC for the api. Look into making my own API for review functionality.

backend and database functionality will be important to get more comfortable with.
